# AI Tagging

We've added a new feature in Linkwarden 2.9 that automatically tags your links based on their content. This feature uses a local AI model to analyze the content of your links and can assign tags to links in 2 ways:

1. **Auto-generate Tags**: When a link is added, Linkwarden will automatically generate and assign tags based on the content of the link.
2. **Using Predefined Tags**: You can also use predefined tags to let Linkwarden auto-assign tags based on the content of the link.

You can enable this feature in the Settings > Preferences page.
