# Links

links, also known as Bookmarks, Webpages, or URLs are one of the core components of Linkwarden (hence the name).

## Adding a Link

You can add a new Link by clicking the "**+ New Link**" button on the top-right of the screen.

A couple of things to consider:

- The "Address" field is mandatory.
- The "Collection" field is also mandatory, BUT will be set as "**Unorganized**" if nothing is provided. If left at this value, a new Collection (named "Unorganized") will be created if it doesn't already exist.
- The "Description" field will be autogenerated based on the webpage title if nothing is provided.
- The "Name" field overwrights the "Description" field while being displayed in the Link card.
