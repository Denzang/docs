# Collections

Collections are basically folders, which can be shared with your team and/or with the public.

## View all Collections

You can view all your Collections by clicking on the "**Collections**" tab on the top-left of the screen. You can also get an overview of the Collections you have access to from the sidebar.

## View individual Collections

Clicking on the Collection card directs you to the Collection, below we have all our Links under the "Health And Wellness" Collection:

## Creating Collections

You can add a new Collection by clicking the "**New Collection**" card in the Collections page.

![Add Collection Dialog](/img/add_collection.png)

From there, you can set a **Name**, **Color**, and **Description** for the new Collection right out of the box.

## Sharing a Collection

Click on the top-right of each Collection card to open a dropdown menu for each Collection, from there, click on "**Share/Collaborate**" to open the Share & Collaboration modal for that specific Collection:

### Make a Collection Public

You can share a specific Collection with the world under a specific address by clicking "**Make this a public collection**", under the "**Make Public**" section.

### Adding a Member

Under the "**Member Management**" section, there's a textbox that allows you to add members. Fill in the textbox with the username of the user you want to add to your collections.

### Managing the Permissions

There are 3 types of permissions each member can have:

- **Create**: The member can create Links under a specific Collection.

- **Update**: The member can update Links that are already created by either the owner OR the members who have the permission to "Create" Links.

- **Delete**: The member can delete Links that are already created by either the owner OR the members who have the permission to "Create" Links.

:::caution

Make sure you trust who you add to a Collection even if you didn't assign any permissions to them. Members under a Collection always have "**Read**" permission, so they can see the Links (and Link content) in the Collection.

:::

Lets go for an example. In the following Collection, the user "Aiden" has _Delete-Only_ permissions. The user "Sarah" has _Create_, _Update_, and _Delete_ permissions. Lastly, "Ben" is the Collection owner.

### Removing a Member

Simply clicking the "x" on the top-right of each member (and clicking "Save") will remove the member from the current Collection.

## Deleting a Collection

To delete a Collection, click the "**Delete Collection**" button in the menu for each Collection. Since this may be triggered accidentally and there's no going back, you are required to enter the Collection's name to confirm your request.
