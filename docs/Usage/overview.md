## Links, Tags, and Collections

At the core there's three types of data you're dealing with:

- **Link**: Also known as a Bookmark, Webpage, or URL.
- **Collection**: Think of this as a folder, which can be shared with your team and/or with the public.
- **Tags**: An additional layer of categorization through keywords for individual Links, enabling precise filtering and searching.

Each user can have an unlimited number of Links, Tags, and Collections.

### Difference between Collections and Tags

Simply put, each Link can only belong to one Collection, but can have multiple Tags. Another difference lies in their shareability: Collections can be shared and collaborated on, but Tags are not shareable.
