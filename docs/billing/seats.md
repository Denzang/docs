# Manage Seats

## Overview

In Linkwarden, you can increase the number of seats in your subscription to invite/add more users and also save additional links. Each new user can independently manage their own links, collections, and tags. You can also add these users to your collections to collaborate on gathering articles and resources, depending on their collection permissions.

## How Seats affect Billing

Here’s how adding seats works in different scenarios, if you still had any questions or need help with managing seats, feel free to contact us at [support@linkwarden.app](mailto:support@linkwarden.app).

### During the 14-day Free Trial

If you are still on the 14-day free trial, you can invite users and add seats without any charges. Once the trial period ends, you will be charged for the total number of seats in your subscription.

### During a Paid Subscription

If you are already an active subscriber, you will be charged for the total number of seats in your subscription at the end of the billing cycle. The charges will be **prorated** based on the number of days remaining in the billing cycle, so you only pay for the additional seats for the remaining days.

:::note

If you're an active subscriber, as soon as you update your subscription, the billing cycle will reset and you will be charged for the new number of seats **immediately**. The next billing cycle will be based on the new number of seats.

## How to Add a User

When adding a new user, Linkwarden checks if there are available open seats. If there’s an open seat, it will be assigned to the new user. If not, an additional seat will be added to your subscription.

1. Go to the [Billing](https://cloud.linkwarden.app/settings/billing) page.

2. Right below the "Manage Seats" section. Click on the "Invite User" button.

3. A modal will appear. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite.

4. Click on the "Send Invitation" button. The user will receive an email with an invitation link.

5. Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be onboarded to use Linkwarden with their own account and you will be charged for an additional seat.

## How to Remove a User

1. Go to the [Billing](https://cloud.linkwarden.app/settings/billing) page.

2. Right below the "Manage Seats" section. Click on the three dots icon next to the user you want to remove.

3. Click on the "Remove" button. A confirmation modal will appear.

4. Click on the "Confirm" button to proceed. The user will be removed from your subscription and you will no longer be charged for that seat.

:::note

Removing a user from your subscription does not delete their account. They retain the ability to subscribe to Linkwarden independently with their existing account.

## How to Reserve Seats

You can add seats without immediately inviting users. This allows you to expand your seat count for future use, even if you’re not ready to invite new users yet. Each additional seat also enables you to add up to 30,000 more links under your subscription.

1. Go to the [Billing](https://cloud.linkwarden.app/settings/billing) page.

2. Right below the "Billing Settings" section. Click on "Billing Portal" to go to the billing portal which is managed by Stripe.

3. Log in to the billing portal using your Linkwarden email address.

4. Click on the "Update Subscription" button. On the next page, you can increase the number of seats in your subscription.
